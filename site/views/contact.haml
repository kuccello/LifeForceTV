        Dear Buyer! This is fully working contact form with validation of each field, including validation of inserting the right format of e-mail address. You can try it by hitting Send button. After you  will buy this template, you have to open send.php and replace the dummy e-mail address with your own and you are ready to go. It's that easy!
      %form.contact_form{ :method => "post", :action => "send.php" }
        %p
          %input#name{ :type => "text", :name => "name" }
          %label{ :for => "name" }
            Your Name*
        %p
          %input#mail{ :type => "text", :name => "mail" }
          %label{ :for => "mail" }
            E-mail*
        %p
          %textarea#text{ :rows => "10", :name => "text", :cols => "10" }
        %p
          %input#send{ :type => "submit", :name => "send", :value => "Send" }
